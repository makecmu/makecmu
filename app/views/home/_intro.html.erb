    Make CMU is a student-run, interdisciplinary organization supporting people at Carnegie Mellon University who <b>make things with computers</b>. Our members focus on the practical application of their knowledge—on making things—rather than the theoretical. We create real projects that are useful to the campus community and beyond.

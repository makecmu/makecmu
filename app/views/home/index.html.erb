	<h3>A hack space for students</h3>
	
	<p>	MakeCMU is a student organization at Carnegie Mellon University
		dedicated to building neat technology & design-related projects.
		MakeCMU loves new ideas - talking them over with friends, losing
		entire weekends to planning and building them, and at the end of 
		the day, being able to step back and say "I built that!"</p>
	
	<!-- Insert graphic here -->	
	
	<p>	<em>Our Mission</em> is to bring together idea-filled CMU students
		and build a hack space for developers, engineers, artists, and designers
		to finally program or weld or paint their ideas together.  Using our
		diverse talents, we can help you dive into fields you've never touched
		before.</p>
